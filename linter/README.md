# jsonnet-lint

Very basic experimental, quick and a bit dirty linter. It's intended to become a full featured linter as it matures. PRs are very welcome!

Don't expect much from it now.

## Notes

It currently runs on a desugared file. It has its good and bad sides.
We should figure out what's the right way.
